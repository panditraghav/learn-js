# Functions

- Parameter of functions are passed by value so the change that we do inside function is not reflected globally.
- If parameter is an object then the change can be reflected globally.
- Functions are hoisted.

## Function Scope

- Function defined in global scope can access all the variables and objects in global scope.
- Function defined inside a function can access all variables in scope of parent function and the variables that parent function can access.
